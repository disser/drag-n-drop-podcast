INTRODUCTION

	The 'rss.py' program can create an RSS overview of music in your current directory and the directories below. This means that you can copy/paste your music and let the program take care of all the XML tags in the RSS feed. I use this to keep an update collection of my music across all my devices, but it is also very useful to quickly share music without the use of cables (I'm looking at you, iPhone). 

	Make sure not to share copyrighted content and/or to set your IP filtering correctly :-)

REQUIREMENTS

	- A webserver (public/private)
	- Music (the folder layout is irrelevant)
	- Configuration of some variables in 'rss.py' (these are clearly marked)
	- Podcast software that can accept RSS feeds (everything except for iTunes seems to work, I'm using Banshee on Ubuntu and Downcast on iPhone myself)

INSTALL

	Clone this repository. You need to have 'python-eyed3', it can be retrieved using your favourite package manager. Next, run the program in the root of your music folder and you will receive an XML file.

EXAMPLES

	An example output can be found in 'example.xml'

INSTALL

	The script has been tested under Debian and Ubuntu. Clone the Git repository and run the rss.py program in the root of your music folder. The generated XML file which you can use with RSS will appear in your folder. PROTIP; add a cronjob that runs the program periodically so that the RSS reflects the contents of the directory.

FUTURE WORK

	Optimize the tags that are given and add support for other types of files.
